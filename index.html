            <p>If you are here, you want to know more about Istanbul and why should be the place to go in your semester, holiday or weekend break. Here a few reasons why Istanbul is the place to run to: </p> 

            <h3>Cultural and History</h3>
            
            <p>Istanbul is the only city in the world that it is across two continents: Europe and Asia The Bosphorus Strait divides the city, offering stunning views and the chance to experience two cultures in one city. </p>
            <p>Besides that, Istanbul has been the capital of three major empires: the Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. Important landmarks like the Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, and the Blue Mosque are steeped in history.</p>
            
            <h3>Must-Try Dishes</h3>
            <p>Istanbul has an amazing cuisine, from delicious meat food like kebabs to amazing sweets like bakhlava, Istanbul is the best place to have food on the Spring or Fall. In Istanbul you will find: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kebabs:</strong> Turkish kebabs, such as the <span class="highlight">Adana</span> made with minced lamb or beef, mixed with spices, and grilled on skewers, are a staple in Turkish cuisine. The <span class="highlight">Iskender</span> kebab is served on a bed of pita bread, topped with a tomato sauce, yogurt, and melted butter, offering a combination of rich and savory flavors.</li>
                <li><strong>Lahmacun:</strong> Lahmacun is a thin flatbread topped with a mixture of minced meat, typically lamb or beef, herbs, and spices like cumin and paprika. It's often served with a squeeze of lemon and fresh parsley, adding a refreshing taste to the savory dish.</li>
                <li><strong>Balık Ekmek:</strong> This is a popular Istanbul street food: grilled mackerel fish, seasoned and served in a sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. The sandwich is a simple yet flavorful choice, best enjoyed at the waterfront in <span class="highlight">Eminönü</span>, where the lively atmosphere enhances the experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Baklava:</strong> Baklava is made from layers of thin phyllo dough filled with crushed pistachios or walnuts. After baking, it’s soaked in a sweet syrup made from sugar, water, and lemon. For an authentic taste, visit places like <span class="highlight">Karaköy Güllüoğlu</span>, known for its traditional recipe and perfect balance of sweetness and crunch.</li>
            </ul>            

        <h3>Coffee and Tea Culture</h3>
        <p>If you enjoy a good coffee or hot drinks, Istanbul needs to be in your list of places to visit. You probably gonna be craving for a good coffee on the Spring with the lower temperature, you gonna find:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turkish Coffee:</strong> Visit historic cafes like <span class="highlight">Mandabatmaz</span> for a strong, aromatic brew served with a side of Turkish delight.</li>

        <p><em>Insider Tip:</em> Learn how to interpret your coffee grounds for a fun fortune-telling experience!</p>
        <p> In Turkey, coffee fortune-telling, or tasseography, is a traditional and fun cultural practice. After finishing a cup of Turkish coffee, the leftover grounds at the bottom of the cup are interpreted to reveal insights about your past, present, or future. This can include symbols, shapes, or patterns formed by the grounds when the cup is inverted onto a saucer.</p>

            <h3>Bargain Guide in Istanbul</h3>
                <p>Bargaining is an integral part of the shopping and dining culture in Turkey, particularly in markets, smaller shops, and some restaurants. While the art of negotiation might seem intimidating at first, understanding the tactics used by salespeople and knowing how to approach bargaining can save you a significant amount of money and ensure you get the best value for your money. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the bargaining process effectively.</p>
            
                <h4>Common Tactics Salespeople Use and How to Counter Them</h4>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><h3>1. Inflated Initial Prices</h3>
                        <p><strong>What They Do:</strong> Many sellers start with a price that’s significantly higher than the item's real value, especially when dealing with tourists. They assume you may not know the local pricing norms and hope you’ll accept the initial offer.</p>
                        <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Always assume the first price is negotiable and avoid agreeing to it outright. Respond with a counteroffer that is at least 40-50% lower than the initial price.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>2. Creating a Sense of Urgency</h3>
                        <p><strong>What They Do:</strong> Salespeople may claim that an item is “the last one” or that a deal is only valid for a limited time to pressure you into making a quick decision.</p>
                        <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Stay calm and don’t let the urgency sway you. Politely tell them you need time to think or that you’ll come back later. If the deal is legitimate, they’ll still honor it when you return.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Key Phrases in Turkish for Bargaining</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Çok pahalı!</strong> (It's too expensive!)</li>
                            <li><strong>Son fiyat ne?</strong> (What is your final price?)</li>
                            <li><strong>İndirim yapar mısınız?</strong> (Can you give me a discount?)</li>
                        </ul></li>

                    <li>  <h3>Best Places to Bargain in Turkey</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="highlight">Grand Bazaar</span>, Istanbul: Famous for its variety of goods and rich history.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">Spice Bazaar</span>, Istanbul: Known for spices, teas, and local delicacies.</li>
                            <li>Bazaars in <span class="highlight">Cappadocia</span>: Great for unique souvenirs like pottery and carpets.</li>
                            <li>Local markets in smaller towns like <span class="highlight">Gaziantep</span> or <span class="highlight">Antalya</span>: Often less crowded and better for deals.</li>
                        </ul>  <h3>Cultural Tips for Bargaining</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always greet the seller before starting negotiations.</li>
                    <li>Don’t show too much interest in the item; it might make bargaining harder.</li>
                    <li>Be polite and friendly. Sellers appreciate respectful behavior and are more likely to give a discount.</li>
                </ul></li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>When Not to Bargain</h3>
                        <p>Bargaining is not appropriate in high-end stores, supermarkets, or chain restaurants. Save your haggling skills for markets and smaller, independent shops.</p>
                        </li>
                </ul>

            <p>Learn about budget-friendly accommodations and how to find cheap flights to Istanbul, ensuring you get the best deal.</p>
            <p>If you flying from Abu Dhabi I have maybe a bad news for you, the favorite of the budget-friendly traveler - <a href="https://wizzair.com/en-gb"> Wiz</a> - doesn't have flights to Istanbul. However, that are other flight companies with cheap prices that allow you go to Istanbul from Abu Dhabi, such as <a href="https://www.flypgs.com/en"> Pegasus</a> or/and <a href="https://www.flypgs.com/en"> Air arabia</a></p>

            <h3>Searching for cheap places to stay in Istanbul?</h3> 

            <p> Places in Istanbul can be cheap. However, there is a high probability of the prices going up depending of the neighborhood you chose to be, the best thing you could do is go with friends, get an <a href="https://www.airbnb.ae/istanbul-turkiye/stays"> Airbnb </a> and split with them. Istanbul is an intense city with local food and shopping close to buildings full of airbnbs or locals that lived there for years, with that we fully recommend getting an airbnb to have better cultural experience of the city - knowing the city as a local. However, if you still fill an airbnb can be too much, Istanbul has an amazing set of <a href="https://www.booking.com/hostels/city/ae/abu-dhabi.html"> Hostels</a> that you could choose to spent your holiday/break </p>

            <h3>Transport in Istanbul</h3>
            <p>Istanbul is almost an walkable city, if you have a problem in your ankle you gonna have a hard time to go over the streets that were built on high hills, but if you don't have any condition is gonna be good for you calfs so go for it! In terms of going 
                to places on the other side of the river, you can take the Istanbul train or an ship to the other side - specially if you going between the Anatolian (Asian) side and the European Side.</p>
            <p> To get trains or ships, Istanbul uses the same transport system, and you gonna need a pass or the transport card to use it, if you plan to go around a lot in instabul we recommend to get the istanbul transport Card, you can recharge it in any station and it costs around 130 Turkish lyra - a very good investment.</p>
